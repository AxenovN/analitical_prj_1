The analitical_prj_1 is the project I did at Karpov's Course "Data Analytic".

Initial file "n_aksenov_15_variant_2.ipynb" represents the final variant which I sent for checking. And, as You can see, it's awful :')
(the reason for that You can find below)

Now, I need to become a Data Analytic and I have no any other options. My interest in that subject is high, and I feel like I really need it (many thoughts). That's why I'm reworking what have already been done to a better structure and logic.


PS: the "below"
    - On Jan-Feb 2022: I finished the "Data Analitic" course and got an offer from an Airliner to join the Airbus 320 study.
    - On Feb 2022: The War of Russia against the Ukraine => The study was disestablished.
    - On Mar 2022: I try to apply my new skills that I obtained at the "Data Analitic" course to a real business.
    - On Apr 2022: There is a Strong will to become a professional Data Analytic (the Practice named above "lit the fire" again).
